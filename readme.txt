This plugin will add a widget and a shortcode which show the current League of Legends free-to-play champions.

== Description ==

Every week there are 15 new League of Legends champions you can try for free. Our plugin lets you show their icons in any WordPress website. We connect to the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/), cache the data every hour on our server ([alurosu.com](https://alurosu.com)) and we forward the data to you. Our service is free to use and doesn't require an account or any access key.

= Shortcode examples: =
- [lolrotation]

- [lolrotation width=400 creditauthor=1]
